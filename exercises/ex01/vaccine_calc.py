# The datetime data type is imported from the datetime library.
# A datetime object models a specific date and time.

from datetime import datetime

# The timedelta data type is imported from the timedelta library.
# A timedelta object models a "time span", such as 1 day or 1 hour and 3 minutes.
# Subtracting two datetime objects will result in the timedelta between them.
# Adding a datetime and a timedelta will result in the datetime offset by the timedelta.
